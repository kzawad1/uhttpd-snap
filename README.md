# uhttpd-snap

The main reason for this repository is because the orignal tutorial that showed an example of how to build a uhttpd Snap failed.  The link to the tutorial is the following:

The steps for building are the following:
1. Clone the repository using a Terminal on Ubuntu Desktop
`
git clone https://github.com/kzawad1/uhttpd-snap.git
`
2. Navigate into the source code directory.
`
cd uhttpd-snap/
`
3. Build the Snap
`
snapcraft
`
4. The output file uhttpd_0.1.2_amd64.snap will be generated.
5. Install this Snap on a Ubuntu Core capable system.
